                            efficient and user-friendly web applications. With 3 years of professional experience, I have worked
                            with a variety of technologies, including React, Next.js, Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
                            My journey in web development began with a deep curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved
                            into a career where I continuously strive to learn and adapt to new challenges. I thrive in
                            collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions.
                            Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies, and contributing to
                            open-source projects.</p>
